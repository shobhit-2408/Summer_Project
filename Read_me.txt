# Car Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and a dataset designed to predict car prices based on various features. The goal is to leverage data analysis and machine learning techniques to create a robust predictive model.

## Files in This Repository

1. **car_price_model.ipynb**  
   - A Jupyter Notebook containing:
     - Data loading and preprocessing.
     - Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
     - Model training, evaluation, and fine-tuning for predicting car prices.

2. **car_dataset(USA).csv**  
   - Dataset containing information about cars, including features such as make, model, year, mileage, engine size, and price (target variable). 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

### Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the files manually.
2. Open `car_price_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and explore the dataset.
   - Train machine learning models.
   - Evaluate model performance and interpret results.

### Steps Covered in the Notebook

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Normalizing and scaling numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing data distributions.
   - Identifying correlations between features.

3. **Model Building**
   - Training regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
   - Evaluating metrics such as RMSE, R^2, and Mean Absolute Error.

4. **Results**
   - Best-performing model and its performance metrics.
   - Insights and limitations of the model.

### Dataset Details

The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Make**: Manufacturer of the car.
- **Model**: Specific model name.
- **Year**: Manufacturing year.
- **Mileage**: Number of miles the car has been driven.
- **Engine Size**: Engine displacement.
- **Price**: Target variable indicating the car's price.

### Results

The notebook demonstrates the use of various regression algorithms to predict car prices and provides insights into the features that influence pricing.
